            <h3>Notes:</h3>
            <p>Template Literals: use backticks. <span class="code">${}</span> to add expressions. Template Literals are "Super-powered" strings.</p>
            <p>To know if a variable holds a number, you can use <span class="code">number.isFinite(x);</span>. This will return <span class="code">true</span> or <span class="code">false</span>.</p>
            <p>Javascript uses "Data Coercion", but it's better to be explicit on the datatypes to avoid "funny" behaviors like <span class="code">'2' + 4 = '24'</span></p>
            <p>While <span class="code">undefined</span> means that the variable hasn't been assigned yet, <span class="code">null</span> means "no value". The difference is that null is coerced into 0 when used in an arithmetic operation.</p>
            <p>Ternary Operators are a shorthand for writing <span class="code">if...else</span> loops. The syntax is: <span class="code">condition ? (code to run if true) : (code to run if false);</span></p>
            <p>Loops. Js has While loops, Do...While loops, and For loops</p>
            <p>Working with arrays, instead of a for loop, we can use a <span class="code">for-of</span> loop:</p>
            <p><span class="code">for(const value of arrayName){ <br>
                                      actions; <br>
                                  }</span></p>
            <p>There are three ways to declare a function: with a function litera, a function expression, and function constructor. </p>
            <p>DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.</p>
            <p>Arrow functions are sooooo Cool!</p>

        <div class="weekQuestions">
            <h3>Questions:</h3>
            <p>Where and when are bitwise operators actually used in Web development?</p>
            <p>When is it useful to use weak sets? I've never seen them in action.</p>
            <p>Is there any use for the function constructor or it exists only because a function is some sort of Javascript object, and objects have constructors?</p>
            <p>Why is that when you click on the Quiz Ninja below the script starts executing before the page loads? And if a use a <span class="code">target="_blank"</span> attribute in the tag, the page loads but the script doesn't run.</p>
